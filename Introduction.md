# 1. Introduction

The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more. A Jupyter Notebook allows you to combine rich documentation, live and adaptable code, and data visualizations. It can also be used as a tool to share your data analysis with others, collaborate, teach, and promote reproducible science.

The Jupyter Notebook began as an (IPython Notebook); this use of Python makes it an ideal starting point for many people using EO data for the first time. In addition, it currently supports around 40 programming languages, including Python, R and Julia (Ju-pyt-R). We believe it may be a useful tool for a broad range of CEOS agencies and EO data user as:

- This technology lowers the barrier to use, Jupyter notebooks can be provided alongside data in an executable form (Click and Run)
- It provides a good starting point for users wishing to improve their Python skills
- Users are able to obtain meaningful results from EO data quickly
- There are a lot of freely available training materials to support user and help improve  skills
- It can be integrated with data cubes and CEOS Analysis Ready Data
- Jupyter Lab technologies mean that notebooks be deployed as a web service
- It can be used to train large classes (for more advanced countries)
- Notebooks can be run on standalone computer/laptops and can be supplied alongside the relevant data; in regions where there are bandwidth/data download issues.

From recent CEOS CapD and WGISS meetings, we have seen how a number of different CEOS agencies are employing Jupyter notebooks in several different ways.  In a 2021 survey conducted of CEOS agencies  the community strongly indicated there was a need to develop a best practice to ensure the optimal reuse of these valuable but technically fragile research assets.

## 1.1 Purpose of the document 

While Jupyter Notebooks can be a valuable resource, there are issues surrounding input data, processing, technical dependencies and quality.  Poor quality notebooks with hidden dependencies may cause new users a lot of problems. The purpose of this document is to encourage the development of high quality Jupyter notebooks, which are of genuine benefit to the broader community. This  ensure their discoverability, accessibility and
